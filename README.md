# withcode-py-offline
Python module to allow offline code to use simple data visualisation tools available on create.withcode.uk

Create.withcode.uk is designed to allow teachers and students to write, run, debug and share python code as easily as possible.
It includes a `withcode` module that allows you to visualise lists of data as black and white, grayscale or full colour images.

This repository contains an offline version of the `withcode` so that you can use the same tools in other projects or you can use examples and code from create.withcode.uk in classrooms or clubs without an Internet connection

## Example 1: black and white bitmap images
This python code contains a 2D list which can be displayed as a black and white image of a smiley face.

# Instructions

Make sure that the `withcode.py` file is in the same folder as your python code which uses the withcode module, then just run it.
*Tips*: For an easy to use offline Python IDE, I'd recommend Mu https://codewith.mu/ 
Make sure you use version 1.02 or later as previous versions didn't allow you to import local modules correctly.
